# How to Access AI Log Analysis

## Navigation Fixed! ‚úÖ

The "Logs" link has been removed from the main sidebar navigation because AI Log Analysis requires a specific build ID to work. Instead, you can access it through the Jobs pages.

---

## How to Access AI Log Analysis

### Method 1: Via Job Detail Page (Recommended)

1. **Go to Jobs Page**
   - Click "Jobs" in the sidebar
   - Or navigate to: http://localhost:6000/jobs

2. **Select a Job**
   - Click on any job from the list
   - This will open the Job Detail page

3. **View Build History**
   - Scroll down to see the "Build History" section
   - Each build has an "AI Analysis" button

4. **Click "AI Analysis"**
   - Click the "AI Analysis" button next to any build
   - This will take you to: `/logs/:buildId`
   - The AI will analyze that specific build's logs

### Method 2: Direct URL (If you know the build ID)

Navigate directly to:
```
http://localhost:6000/logs/<build-uuid-here>
```

Example:
```
http://localhost:6000/logs/123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000
```
